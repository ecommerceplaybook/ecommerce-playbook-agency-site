Business Context Summary – eCommerce Playbook

eCommerce Playbook is a Shopify-focused CRO and growth partner for DTC brands that want to turn more of their existing traffic into revenue before they ramp ad spend. Instead of chasing vanity redesigns or random “best practices,” we use data, customer behavior, and structured experimentation to fix the points in your funnel where money is leaking—so more visitors buy now, buy more, and come back again.

Who We Work With

We partner with Shopify and Shopify Plus brands typically doing $50k–$400k+/month that know their store is underperforming relative to traffic, ad spend, or product-market fit. Common situations:
	•	ROAS is shrinking and CAC is too high, but the team doesn’t want to keep pouring more money into ads.
	•	The brand has tried design tweaks or “best practice” changes, but conversion rate and AOV haven’t moved in a meaningful way.
	•	The site looks good on the surface, yet checkout, PDPs, collection pages, or mobile UX are quietly killing conversions.
	•	Leadership wants a clear, step-by-step CRO roadmap instead of scattered ideas and untracked experiments.

The Core Problem We Solve

Most brands try to grow by adding more traffic before fixing the leaks in their funnel. That leads to:
	•	High acquisition costs and low profit per order
	•	Difficulty scaling ad spend beyond a certain point
	•	Confusion about what’s actually working on the site

eCommerce Playbook focuses on turning the traffic you already have into more customers, larger baskets, and higher repeat purchase rates—so growth becomes more profitable and more predictable.

How eCommerce Playbook Works

We operate as a specialized Shopify CRO and implementation partner with three main pillars:
	1.	CRO Audit & Roadmap
	•	Deep-dive into analytics (GA4), onsite behavior (heatmaps/session recordings), and key flows (homepage, collections, PDPs, cart, checkout).
	•	Identify the biggest opportunities and friction points across Conversion Rate, Average Order Value, and Repeat Purchase behavior.
	•	Deliver a prioritized CRO roadmap with clear hypotheses, projected impact, and implementation order.
	2.	CRO Implementation & Testing
	•	UX and CRO-led design updates to core templates (homepage, PLP, PDP, cart, quiz, landing pages).
	•	Development in Shopify (and headless stacks when appropriate) with tight QA and performance in mind.
	•	A/B testing where it makes sense—measured, powered experiments instead of random split tests.
	3.	Lifecycle & Retention Support (Klaviyo + CX)
	•	Align onsite experience with email flows (welcome, abandoned cart, post-purchase, win-back).
	•	Improve Buy Now / Buy More / Buy Again behavior by making the journey consistent from first click through repeat purchase.

Why eCommerce Playbook Is Different
	•	Conversion-first, not design-first. Every recommendation starts with data, behavior, and business goals—not aesthetics.
	•	Playbook, not guesswork. We use a clear, repeatable CRO process so you know what we’re testing, why, and what we learned.
	•	Strategy + execution in one place. You don’t just get a slide deck; you get the design, development, and implementation to ship improvements.
	•	Built for compounding gains. We focus on improvements that stack: higher conversion rate, stronger AOV, and better retention over time.

In short, eCommerce Playbook exists to help DTC brands stop leaking easy revenue, treat their store like a performance asset, and build a roadmap where every change is tied to a measurable lift in conversions, revenue, and profit.
